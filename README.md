# Online-Railway-Reservation-System-using-Streamlit
This is my second project

' Overview :

The Indian Railways (IR) carries about millions of passengers in reserved accommodation every day. The Computerised Railway Reservation System facilities the booking and cancellation of tickets. These tickets can be booked or cancelled for journeys commencing in any part of India and ending in any other part. In this project we developed a website which help users to find train details, book and cancel tickets and the exact rates of their tickets to the desired destination as well as admin can add, edit and remove train details. With the help of online booking people can book their tickets online through internet, sitting in their home by a single click of mouse.
